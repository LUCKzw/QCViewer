\section{Introduction}
QCViewer is a tool to assist in the design, visualization and simulation of quantum circuits.

\section{Users Manual}

\section{Technical Details}
\subsection{Simulation}
We use a spase state vector based simulation method.  Each state is superposition is stored as a 32-bit integer representing the state in the computational basis
and a complex number representing its amplitude.
