vadym:
- state preparation, measurement, classical feedback?
- "temporary" qubits (long term)
- gates sharing same controls (many-target CNOT)
- Do above in pre-render pass (find parallel CNOT gates and pack into multi-target CNOT)

-----
- Matt and Vadym have code for doing symbolic arithmetic over Z[1/sqrt(2), i].
   (Consider using it).
