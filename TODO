TODO
----

Short term:
  - Symbolic representation of elements in Z[1/sqrt(2), i]. Potentially reuse Vadym's code for sqct.
  - UI-triggered MATLAB output of whole-circuit unitary and unitary for selection.
  - UI-triggered color-coded rendering of circuit and selection unitary.
  - Finish update of documentation, replacing figures and screen captures.
  - Set up and begin maintaining regular builds for Mac OS X.
  - More stringent checks in cmake file.
  - Finish updating user guide.

Medium term:
  - Implement grouping of like-named wires into 'buses' as per discussion with Andrei Lapets.
  - Fix remaining rendering bugs in various edge cases.
  - Implement visual drag-and-drop: Show gate placement as gate is being dragged over circuit.
  - Implement dragging of existing gates from point to point in circuit.
  - Review all code, attempt to clean up crashes.
  - Finish inline code documentation.

Long term:
  - Implement abstract drawing features as per discussion with Martin.
  - Design/implement measurement and classical feedback features.
